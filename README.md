## 🧠 TA_indicators — Custom TradingView & Python Indicators

A growing toolbox of hand-crafted technical analysis scripts.
The plan is to make this repo expansive and accessible to all.
I welcome collaborators and other pinescript or indicator builders!

#### 📂 Indicators Overview

Below is the current lineup, listed in order of creation (MORE TO COME!)

---

#### **1️⃣ 01_SMA.py**

*A simple beginning. Python-based SMA implementation.*

- Written to understand how TA works under the hood  
- Calculates and visualizes Simple Moving Averages  
- Uses **pandas**, **yfinance**, **matplotlib**  
- Foundation piece that helped kick off the repo  

---

#### **2️⃣ 01.1_SMA.pinescript**

*Same concept, but now inside TradingView using .pinescript*

- First TradingView indicator I ever wrote  
- Visualizes SMA directly on the chart  
- Helped bridge Python → Pine Script workflow  
- Very lightweight; a perfect starter script  

---

#### **3️⃣ 02_money_noodle.pinescript**

*A fun experimental oscillator focused on money flow rhythm.*

- Early attempt at blending multiple momentum sources  
- Measures volume impulses and flow “noodles”  
- Aesthetic, experimental, intentionally playful  
- Served as a prototype for bigger ideas later

#### **4️⃣ 03_fusion_oscillator.pinescript — 🚀 FLAGSHIP**

The premier script of the repo — a full-scale multi-indicator engine that blends:

- **MACD (momentum)**  
- **RSI (relative strength)**  
- **MFI (money flow)**  
- **CMF (accumulation/distribution)**  
- **Volume Z-Score (participation heat)**  

All compressed into one adaptive oscillator, featuring:

• Glowing multi-layer curve (Main Oscillator Line: combo of MACD, RSI, MFI, CMF, and Volume Z-Score)
• Dynamic money-pressure cloud (Money flow)
• Divergence detection (bullish & bearish) 
• Precise buy/sell signals 
• Momentum energy histogram 
• Pivot connections & clean visual flow  
• Pinescript version-6 adapted  

**Purpose:**  
To create a **single unified read** on market momentum + flow—without needing six indicators stacked on top of each other.  
This is the **“m00n33k3r”**, my personal go-to indicator, tuned through real chart testing and iteration.

### **Our Aim**

- Build TA tools from scratch (Python + Pine)  
- Document the journey of improvement and iteration  
- Create clean, aesthetic, highly readable code  
- Explore new concepts in momentum, flow, and structure  
- Offer useful building blocks for traders & developers  

---

### **What's Next**

- Backtestable strategy versions  
- Additional oscillators and market-structure tools  
- Liquidity & volatility models  
- Python notebooks for deeper analytics  
- A **“Zim TA Toolkit”** bundle indicator
